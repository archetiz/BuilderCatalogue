Open questions:
- In Stretch goals / 1., can we only collaborate with a single other user or more? Based on the text context & the placement of the exercise, it seems like only one, but it's not clear.
- How is the expected application load? Can we use the current users data as a starting estimate or should we prepare for more?
- In Stretch goals / 2., can they use any pieces or only their current inventory for the new custom set?
